<h2 style=font-family: 'Pacifico', cursive;<h1> Personal information</h1>


<p style = "Color: white;"p> My name is Mohamed Mohamed, I’m an Australian and I stay with my parents in a rented house, here in Melbourne. About my education, I did my schooling at Sirius college and then went off to begin my university education. About my family, both my parents are born in Somalia. We are a family of five and one of my siblings is also currently studying. The main language that is spoken at my home is Somali.</p>

<p style = "Color: white;"p> More about me I’m very quick, in finishing any task that is assigned to me. I get extremely happy when my task is completed on time. I have always been punctual to all my classes at school. I used to join a poem program at my school, and I was wonderful at making poems. An interesting fact about me is that I like writing poems because it’s something I enjoy doing. Also in my free time, I like to play video games with my friends online.

<h2  style="background-color: black; color: white;"<h1>Interest in IT</h1>

<p style = "Color: white;"p> My interest in Information technology came from learning how internet technology operates at high school.  Internet technology is exciting to me, because almost any new gadgets that comes to the market almost always require an internet connection. So, naturally I became curious and wanted to find out how it works.</p>
<p style = "Color: white;"p>There was a technology event that I attended. Which covered how internet speed varies depending on where you live. The type of cable you are using can also affect how fast data can be transmitted for both home and business use. This became extremely thrilling to me.  I have previous experience in IT, I made my first website on Wix.com. I also made several functioning databases on Microsoft Access. </p>
<p style = "Color: white;"p>I choose to study at RMIT for several reasons, mainly because it is a globally recognised university. At the same time, I undergone a lot of research on the internet.I found out that RMIT has many close links the industry I want to work in the future.With these links available to students, RMIT better prepares their students to enter the workforce with confidence. Hence, that’s the reason why I choose to start my undergraduate studies at RMIT.  I’m expecting to learn how to apply the theories that are taught to us, in real life situations and problems.  I am also hoping that we get a chance to do some innovative projects that really encourage our creativity.</p>

<p style = "Color: white;"<p>In a team environment, I may formulate a well written plan that has steps to achieve a certain goal or task. However, if I am spending too much to time on my own. Then I am not cooperating enough with my group. This could pose a potential problem, because I am not taking part in the necessary group discussions.
When forming a team, I need to cooperate more with other group members. Instead of doing the group project on my own, I need to share my ideas and thoughts with the rest of the group members. Group discussions can be through email, zoom calls and many more. Moreover, if things don’t go the way I planned it. It shouldn’t be an issue because, this is a group task where we all need to plan together and organise a group project plan together.
</p>


<h2  style="background-color: black; color: white"<h1>Project Idea- Overview </h1>

<p style = "Color: white;"<p>So, I will put my attention to the game concepts, this is to ensure that the game can function at its best.  I am going to be using gaming software, so I can put high quality graphics to the game I plan on creating. The game development of this game will need a tool; this tool is called Unity.  Unity is wonderful for analysing or writing down your algorithm, it’s also great for the overall design of your game.  Unity gives you the freedom the code in python, this is through their own script editor which allows you to write short scripts.   </p>

<h2  style="background-color: black; color: white"<h1>Motivation</h1>

<p style = "Color: white;"<p>I come from a background that have more than one hobby, whether its music production or gaming creation. This project to me while be interesting, because 5 years ago I used to think this would just a dream that won’t ever happen. According to Statista, “the number of mobile app there were downloaded by consumers in 2021 was 230 million” [1]. Seeing this statistic alone, we can see that there has been a huge increase in game creation in the mobile game industry. Since, the mobile gaming industry is a massively growing industry. We can assume that this number will only increase as more companies start to cash-in. Thus, gaming is one of my favourite hobbies and being able to make a game of my choice will be a fun experience.</p>

<h2  style="background-color: black; color: white"<h1>Description</h1>

<p style = "Color: white;"<p>There are many features I want to add to my game. One of the features that I want to use is making sure that my game is realistic. So, it’s going to involve gravity and probably even physics.  What I mean by gravity and physics, is that there must be a believable amount of physics in the game. For example, if a user is playing a certain character let’s say Mario. So, before Mario begins to jump in the air, he will need to squat before every jump.  The jump animation should have Mario jump in the air in one direction. It will not make sense for Mario to jump in multiple directions after the first jump for instance.  Therefore, the game needs to be realistic in that sense. </p>


<p style = "Color: white;"<p> I would love to see my game either being played as a 2D or even 3D adventure game. A great feature I would also love to add is, to make sure that my game can be played in many different languages. So, that way I can make sure more people have an enjoyable experience when they play my game. For instance, I know that a lot of my friends understand English. However, there may be an instance were they no longer want to listen to the English dialogue. Thus, my game will have a feature available to allows users to play the game in another language with English subtitles. This feature is very similar to Netflix, which gives you do this option when watching a movie or show. </p>

<p style = "Color: white;"<p>Additional features, I would love to add is high quality graphics in my game. This is because from experience in playing games, great games always had amazing graphics. Great graphics can make a huge difference to a player’s experience. Therefore, I want to make sure that any player who play’s my game an amazing experience.  If you look at games like Rayman legends, the aesthetics of that game alone will affect how a player’s experience. This is due to the fact the map in the game is very appealing and polished, and the lighting and music of the game creates an upbeat feeling to the player. So, I want people to have the refreshing feel when they play my game. Therefore, great graphics is very important to me when creating a game.</p>


<p style = "Color: white;"<p>A different feature I will love to incorporate to my game, is responsive controls. This could be in the form of animations to make sure that my game looks more enchanting.  I want to make sure that every key or control is very responsive. At the same time, I want to ensure my game is responsive. In the sense that, there is no lag in any of the key presses. For example, imagine there is a scenario where you want your character to jump. If the jump key is space bar, then you should hit it without waiting a couple seconds. It should be instant. </p>

<p style = "Color: white;"<p>A customisation option would be a fun feature to add because it lets users be creative. This can either be done by changing their outfit of their selected character. This would be a cool option because it allows users to personalise their characters.  It will be a dream to have a video game where you can change your hair colour, voice, and facial expressions. </p>

<p style = "Color: white;"<p>Another note, I want my game to be easy to understand and clear. Players should understand why things happen the way they do. For example, if a player loses, they lose. This would mean players need to get better and need to avoid the same mistakes, if they want to win next time. But if players win, they win. More importantly, I want players to understand the objective of my game to be clear. I don’t want people scratching their heads in confusion when they play my game, I want it easy for new players to understand the fundamentals of my game.  </p>


<h2  style="background-color: black; color: white"<h1>Tools and Technologies </h1>

<p style = "Color: white;"<p>I am not going to need download any extra additional software, for programming on Unity.  Unity comes with own compiler within the engine, so it won’t be necessary to get extra software for programming use.
But, in my game I want to have sound and other tools to start developing my game. So, I going to need to download Gimp for 2D which is free to use. I can also import some sound or image from one of my files on computer. Gimp for 2D can be very helpful as it lets you edit images or start creating your image from scratch. The hardware I am going to use is my gaming computer. But it doesn’t really matter what device you have, even if you have a regular laptop or a regular computer. It should run fine on Unity.
</p>

<h2  style="background-color: black; color: white"<h1>Skills Required</h1>

<p style = "Color: white;"<p>The skills needed to finish this project is the following:
-	 Creative skills are needed for the overall design of the game, the art design can come in many forms. This either of lighting, colour, and a great imagination. This is needed to ensure that the game is appealing to all ages.
-	Good programming skills will be extremely necessary, so that each script is written in a cohesive manner.
-	 The software we are going to need is C++ Java, but there is also another way to use Python in unity.
-	Critical thinking is needed because there isn’t one way in making a game, there are different methods to develop a game. Critical thinking is needed for that reason.
</p>

<h2  style="background-color: black; color: white"<h1>Outcome</h1>

<p style = "Color: white;"<p>The only way to determine if this project is successful is, if the player experience is amazing. This can be shown to be through feedback. Maybe the game is not functioning like it should there may be some bugs that need to be patched. For example, if keys are not working as desired. Small details like this can be crucial and detrimental in shaping another player’s experience. In the future, to solve issues that involve any bugs in the system. Then, I may need to make a prototype to ensure other issues do not ruin the end project. This could help with the overall game development, as it can help me analyse which areas I need to focus on. </p>
